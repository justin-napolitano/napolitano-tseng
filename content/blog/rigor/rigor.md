## Rigor

Market Research reports are often manipulated to appeal to the bias of consumers.  Rounding errors, small alphas, and closed source reports do not provide the rigor that analysis consumer deserve.  

In our experience, technical reports detailing accurate results may not appeal to sales teams, founders, and executives that must justify their product to their board.  We find that papers prepared according to the highest standards defined in the academic literature may not yield the results that consumers may expect. 

Napolitano-Tseng dedicates itself to producing high quality reports that minimize bias to the greatest extent possible.
