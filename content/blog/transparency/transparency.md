## Transparency

Black box models are the norm in the research industry.  Some companies believe that their algorithms and pipelines are a product that must protected from the peering eyes of competitors.  We take another aproach.  

Napolitano-Tseng believes models should be documented and published in order for our clients to ensure that the work provided to them is produced according to the highest industry standards.  When we are chosen to create reports, we include notebooks that document every part of our procedures to our customers.
